## Accolades

I have earned various different accolades in and outside of school, including sports:

 - Part of the school swim team and was part of the relay team that brought the school to district champions.
 - Part of the school cross country team and were the district champions.
 - Part of the school Track & Field team where I competed in hurdles, long jump, high jump, and the 4x200m relay team. We were district champions and I earned the Most Dedicated Runner award.

I have also earned various different academic accolades in and outside of school:

 - Participated in the school Math club.
 - Selected to the 12-member school MathCounts team.
 - Participated in AMC 8, 10, and 12 two years in a row.
 - Participated in SEFH (Science and Engineering Fair of Houston) where I earned 2nd in my category.
 - Participated in TXSEF (Texas Science and Engineering Fair) where I earned 3rd in my category.

NEUROCRANIAL ELECTROSTIMULATION MODELS, SYSTEMS, DEVICES AND METHODSNEUROCRANIAL ELECTROSTIMULATION MODELS, SYSTEMS, DEVICES AND METHODS, US 20120245653 Â· Issued Sep 27, 2012

Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for developing transcranial electrical stimulation protocols are disclosed. In one aspect, a method includes the actions of accepting an image model of target tissue, obtaining a forward model having a first electrode configuration and first electrical stimulation parameters based on electrical stimulation of the target tissue, accepting electrode configuration changes or electrical stimulation parameter changes resulting in a second electrode configuration or second electrical stimulation parameters, determining an optimized tissue model using a least square methodology and based on the second electrode configuration or second electrical stimulation parameter changes, comparing the optimized tissue model with a desired outcome, and providing a confirmation of the optimized model with the desired outcome.
